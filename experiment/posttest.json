      "explanations": {
        "a": "The range of measurement for mold hardness testers and core hardness testers commonly used in foundries typically falls within the range of 0 to 100 units. This scale allows for measuring the hardness of molds and cores effectively within the typical range encountered in foundry applications.",
        "b": "The range of measurement for mold hardness testers and core hardness testers commonly used in foundries typically falls within the range of 0 to 100 units. This scale allows for measuring the hardness of molds and cores effectively within the typical range encountered in foundry applications.",

	"d": "5"
      },
	  
      "explanations": {
        "a": "In some mold hardness testing methods, especially those using instruments like a Brinell hardness tester adapted for mold testing, multiple indentations may be made to obtain an average hardness value across different areas of the mold surface. This approach helps to ensure a more representative measurement of the mold's hardness.",
        "b": "In some mold hardness testing methods, especially those using instruments like a Brinell hardness tester adapted for mold testing, multiple indentations may be made to obtain an average hardness value across different areas of the mold surface.

      "question": "4. What is measured by core hardness tester:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Interior hardness of core",
	"b": "Surface hardness of core",
	"c": "Microhardness of core",
	"d": "Strength of core"
      },
	  
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This is the primary measurement taken by core hardness testers. It assesses how hard the core material is throughout its interior.",
        "b": "While important, surface hardness is typically measured separately and may involve different testing methods or instruments.",
        "c": "Microhardness testing involves very fine scales and is used to measure the hardness of small regions or features within a material, which is not the main focus of core hardness testing.",
        "d": "While hardness is related to strength, core hardness testing specifically focuses on measuring the material's resistance to indentation or penetration, not its overall strength under load."
