      "question": "Why is it necessary to take multiple hardness readings on the mould? (LO2)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To increase the overall hardness of the mould",
        "b": "To get an accurate and uniform measurement of hardness",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": " Hardness can vary at different points of the mould due to inconsistencies in sand compaction. By taking multiple readings, we obtain a more reliable assessment of mould strength. Averaging these readings helps eliminate errors and ensures a uniform mould structure, which is vital for producing high-quality castings.",

      "question": "Why is the rammer used in the mould hardness test? (LO1)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To increase the permeability of the mould",
        "b": "To compact the sand uniformly within the moulding flask",
        "c": "To mix the sand with binding agents",
        "d": "To remove excess moisture from the sand"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": " The rammer is used to apply controlled force on the sand to ensure even compaction in the moulding flask. Uniform compaction is crucial because it prevents weak spots that may lead to casting defects like metal penetration or erosion. It also improves the dimensional accuracy of the final casting.",
