        "a": "Null deflection",
	"b": "Indicating",
	"c": "Integrating",
	"d": "Recording"
      },
	  
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Indicating instruments are designed to provide a direct and instantaneous reading of a measurement. In the context of mold hardness testers and core hardness testers, these instruments might display the hardness value directly on a dial, digital display, or through some other means after the test is conducted.",

      "question": "2. Mould hardness test is comparable to:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Viker's hardness test",
	"b": "Rockwell hardness test",
	"c": "Brinell's hardness test",
	"d": "Knoop hardness test"
      },
	  
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Mold hardness testing is often compared to Brinell hardness testing because both methods involve applying a specific load to indent the material being tested. In mold hardness testing, a standardized test specimen (mold or core) is subjected to a defined load, and the depth or size of the indentation left by the indenter is measured. Similarly, in Brinell hardness testing, a hardened steel ball is pressed into the surface of the material under a specified load, and the diameter of the impression is measured.",

      "question": "3. Moulding sand that is naturally moist is:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Green sand",
	"b": "Parting sand",
	"c": "Facing sand",
	"d": "Backing sand"
      },
	  
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This is a mixture of sand, clay (usually bentonite), water, and sometimes other additives. It is called green sand because it is used in a moist, uncured state. The moisture in green sand helps in compacting and molding processes without the need for additional water.",
        "b": "Parting sand is used to prevent sand molds from sticking to each other or to the pattern. It is a dry, fine sand that is applied on mold surfaces.",
        "c": "Facing sand is used on the mold surface closest to the pattern. It typically has a high-quality, fine grain to give a smooth casting surface finish.",
        "d": "Backing sand is used to back up the facing sand and is used to fill the flask. It supports the facing sand and any cores that are used."

      "answers": {
        "a": "Dark in colour",
	"b": "Hexagonal in structure",
	"c": "Hard",
	"d": "Non-oxidising"
      },
	  
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Tungsten carbide is one of the hardest materials known, second only to diamond in terms of hardness. This makes it ideal for use as the indenter in scratch testers, where it is used to scratch or indent materials of varying hardness to determine their relative hardness.",

      "question": "5. Which of the following cores cannot be used for core hardness test:",

        "a": "Green cores",
	"b": "Dry sand cores",
	"c": "Baked cores",
	"d": "All of the above"
      },
	  
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Dry sand cores cannot be used for core hardness testing because they lack sufficient moisture to hold together and maintain their shape during the test. Core hardness testing typically involves applying a specified load to the core to measure its hardness. Dry sand cores would crumble or disintegrate under such pressure because they do not have the necessary binding properties provided by moisture or binders.",
