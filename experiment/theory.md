### Mould hardness
* Mould hardness is the numeric measure of how hard the mould has been rammed. 
* Mould sand hardness depends upon- degree of ramming, percentage of sand and percentage of water.

### Mould hardness tester
* It is an indentation-type tester which works in a similar manner to Brinell hardness tester in which the ithe depth of insertion of the indentor indicated the value in hundredth of a millimeter. 
* The tester has a dial indicator ranging between 0 to 100.
* The indentor is mechanically a steel ball with a spring loaded plunger.

### Core hardness
* It is the numeric measure of bonding and hardness of the cores.
* Core sand hardness depends upon- degree of ramming, percentage of sand and percentage of binder.

### Core hardness tester
* It is a scratch-type tester in which consists of a carbide tipped plough.
* It is also a dial indicator with the range between 0 to 100.

### Applications
* Mould hardness tester finds out the Green mould hardness of the sand mould prepared by any method e.g: Hand molding, Jolt Squeeze molding etc.
* Core mould hardness finds out the hardness of baked or dried cores made out of core sands, resin sands etc.

### Precautions
1.	Instrument should be kept clean and away from dust, ensuring that all sticking sand is removed from the instrument before and after every test.
2.	Setting and calibration of the testers should not be tampered with.
