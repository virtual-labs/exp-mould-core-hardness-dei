### Mould Hardness

Mould hardness is a numerical measure of how hard the mould has been rammed during preparation. Proper ramming ensures the mould retains its shape during pouring and solidification.

### Factors affecting mould hardness:

1.	Degree of ramming – More ramming increases hardness but may reduce permeability.<br>
2.	Percentage of sand – Higher sand content generally results in higher hardness.<br>
3.	Percentage of water – Optimum moisture is required for proper binding, but excess water can weaken the mould.<br>

### Mould Hardness Tester

The mould hardness tester is an indentation-type tester that functions similarly to the Brinell Hardness Tester. It measures the depth of penetration of an indenter into the mould surface.

### Working Principle:

●	The tester has a dial indicator with a range from 0 to 100.<br>
●	The indenter is a steel ball with a spring-loaded plunger that applies a controlled force.<br>
●	The depth of insertion (in hundredths of a millimetre) determines the hardness value.<br>
 
### Core Hardness

Core hardness is a numerical measure of bonding strength and hardness of baked or dried cores used in casting. Proper core hardness ensures dimensional accuracy and prevents defects during metal pouring.

### Factors affecting core hardness:

1.	Degree of ramming – Affects density and hardness.<br>
2.	Percentage of sand – Affects core structure.<br>
3.	Percentage of binder – Affects bonding strength and core hardness.<br>

### Core Hardness Tester

The core hardness tester is a scratch-type tester used to evaluate the surface hardness of cured cores.

### Working Principle:

●	The tester consists of a carbide-tipped plough that scratches the core surface.<br>

●	The dial indicator has a range from 0 to 100, providing a hardness reading.<br>

### Applications

●	Mould hardness tester: Measures the green mould hardness of sand moulds prepared by different methods (e.g., hand moulding, jolt squeeze moulding).<br>

●	Core hardness tester: Determines the hardness of baked/dried cores made from core sands, resin sands, and other core materials.<br>

### Precautions

1.	Keep the instrument clean and free from dust.<br>
2.	Ensure no sand particles are stuck on the tester before and after each test.<br>
3.	Do not tamper with calibration settings to maintain accuracy.
